Since its inception, the garden has witnessed significant progress and success thanks to the hard work and dedication of the working group, Green Campus, the MU Enviro Soc and the many volunteers and local community of Maynooth who frequent and engage in the garden. </p><p>With the aim of bringing staff, students and wider community of Maynooth together to cultivate fresh healthy produce using sustainable principles, the garden has also greatly contributed to Maynooth Green Campus objectives by enhancing biodiversity and local eco-systems (with over twenty new species recently recorded) and fostering sustainable relationships with land, food and nature by connecting food to human health, well-being and environmental sustainability. In addition to the vegetables and fruits that are planted in the raised beds, the garden also has a collection of native Irish apple trees, plums and raspberries and a recently established wildflower strip.</p><p>Membership and engagement in the garden has increased significantly this academic year, and a number of events have taken place. These include: ‘Green Day’ workshops, the ‘Food Sovereignty Festival’, contributing to ‘Take the Pulse’ project, ‘Foraging, Herbal Tea and Pesto Workshops’ using produce from the garden. In addition, engagement in the garden has also resulted in a new ‘Soil/Food Connections Group’ with a variety of workshops, events and research projects scheduled for the forthcoming academic year.</p><p>Whilst preparations for Phase 3 extension of the garden have already commenced, over the summer months, plans to enhance the garden are already in place including; a new composting bay and water harvesting system, signage and a new Green House to enhance cultivation. Students are already working with the WG on producing a digital cookbook on healthy eating on a budget, using produce from the garden, which we hope, will be available for incoming and current students this coming September.</p><p>The WG and Enviro Soc meet in the garden on Tuesdays, between 12-2pm, so why not come down and try your hand at planting and cultivating some health fruit and veg. Or, if you have any suggestions, want to host, or get involved in an event please email patricia.healykettle@mu.ie</p><p><b>Bees</b></p><p>The edible garden is the last stop on the North Campus Bumblebee monitoring Route and is a hotspot for a diversity of insects and birds.
