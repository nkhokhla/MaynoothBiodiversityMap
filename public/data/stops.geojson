This mowing regime has resulted in the meadow becoming extremely rich in clovers (purple and white) which support a diversity of insects during the summer particular the common carder bee Bombus pascuorum. A number of bee orchids were found on the site in 2019.</p><p>The plaza has a number of raised beds that are planted with laurel and lavender which support bees, hoverflies and butterflies and has another raised lawn that has several trees. The raise lawn is mown every 6-8 weeks. The edges of this area were traditionally spayed with glyphosate which exposed the soil on the south facing bank. This encouraged a large aggregation of a number of species of mining bees (Andrena spp). However, with the reduction of chemical pesticide use across the campus the bank has become dominated by grasses and the number of solitary bees and their nests has been greatly reduced. This highlights an important aspect of grounds management, in that the actions that we think are beneficial may have negative consequences. Research is planned to determine sustainable and environmentally friendly ways to expose the bank to promote mining bee colonisations once again.</p><p><b>Mowing plan</b>: Cut roughly every 6 – 8 weeks to a height of 5- 6 inches.
